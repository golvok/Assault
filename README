A simple RTS framework, mostly for fun and practice.

requires 
	lwjgl (make sure it is the rigt version -- check Assault_lib/ and OSutil)
	slick 2D
	jdom2

The file lwjgl-x.x.x should be a link to a folder containg the expanded contents of the lwjgl zip download (only the native folder is actually important)
